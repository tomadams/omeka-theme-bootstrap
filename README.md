Omeka Bootstrap Theme
=====================

This theme for Omeka 2.2, utilizes Twitter Bootstrap to provide a responsive web interface for CSHL's libgallery.cshl.edu

This originally was an Omeka 1.5 theme and now supports Omeka 2.0 API. This Omeka 2.2 version of the code is not yet in production.

A few CSHL specific items are embedded within the theme. To be useful for other Omeka websites, some of the code will need to be tweaked.
